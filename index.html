<p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
<p>Console is a basic computer or monitor and keyboard that is connected to another computer, server, or a mainframe over a network. It is used to maintain or monitor the status of the network or computer.</p>
